The final executable was compiled on this machine: gl11

How to invoke my program:
  ./rt
  Use `./rt -h` to get the list of options. Most features are switched
  off by default and can be toggled on.

In the data directory is a folder titled `images` containing a set of images
for each objective.  All other files in the data directory are scenes that
were or are used to generate the images.

My program assumes the following:
  Compiled with g++ >= 4.9

  Note that the graphics lab machines have g++ 4.8.  To compile on the graphics
computers, add this code snippet to the top of RayTracer.cpp

  #include <memory>
  #include <utility>

  namespace std {
    template<typename T, typename... Args>
    std::unique_ptr<T> make_unique(Args&&... args) {
      // Pining for C++14...
      return std::unique_ptr<T>(new T(std::forward<Args>(args)...));
    }
  }

Objectives:
   1. Primitives: Cylinder + Torus
   2. Specular Reflection
   3. Refraction & transparency
   4. Texture Mapping: Planes + Spheres; Functions + Bitmaps
   5. Adaptive Supersampling
   6. Uniform Grid Acceleration
   7. Soft Shadows + Area Lights
   8. Phong Shading + Normal Interpolation
   9. Glossy reflection
  10. Unique scene
