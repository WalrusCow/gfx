<h1>
CS488/688 A1 Marking</h1>
Listed on this page are mistakes/problems we explicitly check for in A1 and
deduct points for.  <i><b>You should not consider this list to be complete.</b></i>

<br>Caution: This is the marking scheme for the old A1; while there are
many similarities, the new A1 will have significant variation from this scheme.
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> The deductions listed on these and other Marking pages are
guidelines only and are subject to TA discretion including, but not limited
to, the number of marks deducted.  We
generally expect students to make "reasonable" decisions as well as
reasonable effort in complete and correct implementations.
