<h1>CS488/688 A3 Marking</h1>

Listed on this page are mistakes/problems we explicitly check for in A3 and
deduct points for.  <i><b>You should not consider this list to be complete.</b></i>
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> The deductions listed on these and other Marking pages are
guidelines only and are subject to TA discretion including, but not limited
to, the number of marks deducted.  We
generally expect students to make "reasonable" decisions as well as
reasonable effort in complete and correct implementations.

<h4>A3:</h4>
</FONT>

-0.5 for the following:
<UL>
<li> The head should not be rotated into body when two buttons are depressed
in the same time
<li> Picking should work after the position of puppet has changed
<li> The orientation of trackball should be correct, regardless of whether the
puppet is facing us or facing away.
<li> Trackball transformations should be premultiplied, otherwise
the rotation is inconsistent once you have flipped the puppet.
<li> Trackball &amp; translation/zoom should be kept on separate
nodes
so you don't rotate around the origin
<li> When calling your hierchical traversal routine for picking,
remember to do your initial view translations as
well.
<li> Document your transformation nodes as well.
<li> You need transformation nodes above each joint so rotation
doesn't occur around the center of spheres.
<li> To get the togl raster to fill the whole window, you need
to set parameters in the raster and the raster's parent frame
as well.
<li> If your puppet's movement are jerky, it is because you
didn't use a display list, or your spheres are tessellated
too finely.
<li> You need to turn on cull face for backfacing polygon removal
<li> You should scale the trackball by 180 degrees to get the
180 degree rotations.
<li> You need to make the diameter of the trackball 1/2 of min
(screen width, screen height) so it will conform
to the circle.
<li> Your rotations for the head should be called on different
joints so the head won't rotate into the body.
<li> Implement short cut keys!!!
</UL>

+1 For exceptional work
