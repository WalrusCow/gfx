  <h2>C++ Ray Tracer</h2>
  <p>This is a ray tracer I wrote in C++ for CS 488. It has several advanced
    features such as adaptive anti-aliasing, uniform space partitioning and
    several distributed ray tracing techniques.</p>
  <p>Below is a description of each objective for the course project, as well
    as a few images for each one.</p>

  <div class="description">
  <p>Torus and cylinder were implemented as extra primitives. A torus is
    created by specifying the radius of its "tube". Both are set to standard
    sizes and can then be transformed, as with all other primitives. </p>
  <p>Torus intersections are computed as the result of a quartic equation.
    Cylinder intersections are done by intersecting with an infinite cylinder
    then checking against the cylinder height.</p>
  <p>The second image shows the cylinder primitive on the left, and a basic
    mesh of a cylinder on the right.</p>

  <div class="description">
  <p>Specular reflection was added by recursively casting a ray from the
    point of intersection with an object. A maximum recursive depth configurable
    as command-line input is used to terminate.</p>
  <p>The final image shows a scene in a box of mirrors with increasing maximum
    depth. The depth begins with 0 (no reflection) and goes to 6.</p>

  <div class="description">
  <p>Transparency is also implemented recursively, by casting a ray from the
    point of intersection with a transparent object. The transmitted ray is
    perturbed according to snell's law, giving us the refractive effect.</p>
  <p>In the second image, the sphere is far enough away from the background that
    the refraction has inverted the transmitted image.</p>
