<h1>CS488/688 A4 Marking</h1>

Listed on this page are mistakes/problems we explicitly check for in A4 and
deduct points for.  <i><b>You should not consider this list to be complete.</b></i>

<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> The deductions listed on these and other Marking pages are
guidelines only and are subject to TA discretion including, but not limited
to, the number of marks deducted.  We
generally expect students to make "reasonable" decisions as well as
reasonable effort in complete and correct implementations.

<h4>A4:</h4>
</FONT>

-0.5 for the following:
<UL>
<li>README should really be in the right place by now.
<li>Pages should be stapled in the right order.
<li>You need to give us comparison images for things like
supersampling (keep this in mind for your
projects).
<li>Unique background should have been rendered on every
scene.
<li>For those of you who implement reflection, keep in
mind that 100% reflective surfaces doesn't
occur in the real world, things look much better if
you make them about 80% reflective or less.&nbsp; Making
things 100% reflective also makes it hard or impossible
to see the boundaries of the "mirrors".
<li>If your eye point is too far, or your fov is too wide,
the objects near the edges will appear distorted
 (stretched).
<li>For scaling to work properly, you need to normalize
the ray every time you transform it.
<li>The images shouldn't be upside down.
<li>The background shouldn't obscure the view.
<li>If images look washed out and shadow areas are gray, it
is probably because you are adding the ambient light to your
colour instead of ambient*node_material.
</UL>

<p>Bonus marks were allocated by the prof and the TAs
together.  We give out 1/2 marks.  Bonus marks are allocated based on:
<UL>
<li>aesthetics
<li>complexity
</UL>

<br>SAVE GOOD PICTURES!
