The final executable was compiled on this machine: gl15

How to invoke my program: ./rt <scene_file.lua>

How to use my extra features:
  Run rt_antialias instead of rt.
  To change rate of sampling, edit a4.cpp and change the constants
  superSampleX and superSampleY. The provided executable is 3x3.

  To run and render the bounding box, edit mesh.cpp and change the macro
  BOUNDING_BOX_RENDER from false to true


I have created the following data files, which are in the data directory:
  sample.lua
    A custom scene.  In the scene there is a plane for the floor and there are
    four instances of a single spherical fractal.
    For good measure, I included a buckyball and a cube which float in mid air.

There are two executables provided:
  rt : Basic raytracer
  rt_antialias : Same raytracer but with 3x3 supersampling.

My program assumes the following: Compiled with g++ >= 4.8
