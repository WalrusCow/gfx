The final executable was compiled on this machine: gl15

How to invoke my program: ./rt <scene_file.lua>

How to use my extra features:
  Run rt_antialias instead of rt.
  To change rate of sampling, edit a4.cpp and change the constants
  superSampleX and superSampleY. The provided executable is 3x3.


I have created the following data files, which are in the data directory:
  sample.lua
  A custom scene.  In the scene there is a plane for the floor and there are
  four instances of a single spherical fractal.
  For good measure, I included a buckyball and a cube which float in mid air.

There are two executables provided:
  rt : Basic raytracer
  rt_antialias : Same raytracer but with 3x3 supersampling.

My program assumes the following: Compiled with g++ >= 4.8
